## Hosting Your Complete App
This guide will walk you through the process of hosting your complete MERN stack app on cyclic configuration.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. Organize your project with a root directory that contains both `frontend` and `backend` folders.
2. Ensure both `backend` and `frontend` directories have all necessary code and dependencies.

* Note: Using this configuration will require you to run `npm run build` in the frontend directory before deploying.

+ Ensure your folder structure looks like this:
```bash
root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

- Push all your code to GitHub, ensuring to include a `.gitignore` file to ignore the `node_modules` folder and `config.env` file.

## Step 3: Create a Cyclic Account
- Sign up for a Cyclic account if you haven't already.
- Connect your GitHub account to Cyclic.

## Step 4: Create a Cyclic Project
- Create a new project in Cyclic.
- Select your GitHub repository (e.g., Elite-shop).

## Step 5: Configure Project Settings
- Configure the project settings:
  - Keep the settings as they are.
  - Add all your `config.env` variables in the Environment Variables section.

## Step 6: Deploy Your App
- Click on "Deploy" and wait for a few minutes for the deployment process to complete.

## Step 7: Visit Your App
- Once the deployment is successful, click on "Visit" to access your live app.

## Step 8: Enjoy Your App
- Congratulations! Your app is now live and accessible.
